After initial cleaning and tidying the dataset, I plan to do explanatory data analysis for an overview of Curry’s and GSW team’s performance throughout this 14 years period. I plan to focus my project on two problems: (1) Is Curry’s performance improving throughout his career? (2) Is Curry a key player in his team?

To approach problem (1), I plan to separate the data into “Curry” section and “GSW Team” section, and use “Curry” section mainly for my analysis. For “Curry” section of the dataset, I plan to visualize his history stats from 2009 to 2021 season. Maybe I can start with marking out the peak (maximum), the bottom (minimum), and significant upward/downward trends (slopes). Then, I plan to try fitting a comprehensive model using these values to explain the fluctuation of Curry’s performance from his personal perspective. The final goal of problem (1) will be to train my model using 2009-2021 season data and see if his performance of 2022 season can be predicted using historic data. Since this dataset has been recently updated with 2022 season data, I can use this part as my test data to validate my model.

For problem (2), I will first do lots of data visualization, giving graphs and tables for Golden States Warriors overall performance with 2009-2021 part of data. I expect there will be many games that Curry doesn’t play much due to injuries, so I will need to clean and filter the dataset before I can begin my analysis. Based on Curry’s presence, I can start digging if team’s performance, such as Win/Loss and total score, are caused by Curry or by other factors. To arrive at a conclusion, I may need to look up GSW news on the Internet to find out possible causes of GSW’s performance. (Ex. When Klay Thompson was injured, we cannot blame Curry for his team’s poor play.)
