For this project, I plan to investigate the Astros' cheating scandal regarding their use of loud bangs on a trash can to signal to their batters what pitch was coming next. Here're some popular questiona regarding this scandal:
  
1. What was the usual outcome of a batting event when a bang was heard (single, double, home run, or grand slam)?

2. Was the number of bangs different for each opponent or were they more heavily used against better opposition? 

3. At what point in the season did the number of bangs substantially increase? 

We pretty directly answered those questions as a part of our project.The main goal focuses on learning as much about the Astros' cheating scandal as possible. This ranged from looking at how they used the bangs on the trash cans to whether it actually had an impact on what happened in the game. This culminated in the aim of this project -- to determine if the Astros' cheating made a difference in whether they won or lost a given game.
